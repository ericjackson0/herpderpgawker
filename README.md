##Herp Derp Gawker Media
========================

Chrome extension to improve all Gawker Media sites by herp derping the user comments. Created primarily for Deadspin commenters, as they tend to need the most fixing.

#Example:
--------
Original:	"your favorite player SUCKS!!1! lol srsly he's the ****ing WORST!1!"
Derped:		"herp herp derp herp derp derp derp herp derp"

Much better.

##How to install it:
-------------------
1. Download the folder called "Source"
2. Rename it as "Herp Derp Gawker Media".
3. Open the "Extensions" page via the Tools menu in Chrome (or go to chrome://extensions)
4. Click on "Load unpackaged extension...".
5. Select the folder "Herp Derp Gawker Media".

##Note
======
This was created mainly for Deadspin. Deadspin uses the new Kinja system and this converts the comments fine.
On older Gawker Media sites (such as Gawker or Gizmodo), it simply replaces the entire comment section with herped derps.

Click on the herp derped comment to reveal the original, witty, super-funny (I'm sure) comment.
